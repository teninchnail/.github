Brief summary of what this Epic is, whether it's a larger project, goal, or user story. Describe the job to be done, which persona this Epic is mainly for, or if more multiple, break it down by user and job story.

## [Feature Mapping](https://github.com/unioophere/FMP-General-Information/blob/master/Behaviour_Driven_Development/Behaviour_Driven_Development.md)

- [ ] Define what actors are involved in the story
- [ ] Break the feature into tasks to identify the main flows
- [ ] Identify examples that illustrates a principle or variant flow. Ask questions like “But what if…”, “what else could lead to this outcome”, “what other outcomes might happen”, and use the answers to create new examples. Use rules to explain and give context to your examples. Rinse and repeat for other rules and examples
- [ ] Create Executable Specifications(Given, When, Then): automate the main high-level flows with pending steps
- [ ] Add these Specifications to this Epic

## Wireframing

- [ ] Create low-fidelity wireframes, that meet the requirements
- [ ] Review the wireframes and decide for one solution to be prototyped
- [ ] Add wireframe to this Epic

## Prototyping

- [ ] Create an interactive high-fidelity prototype with the final design
- [ ] Review Prototype and check if all requirements are met
- [ ] Add prototype to this Epic

## Define Dev Tasks

- [ ] Define all needed code changes/additions for Frontend, Backend, Ops
- [ ] Define what needs to be tested
- [ ] Define what needs to be logged
- [ ] Add all tasks to this Epic/Create Issues connected to this Epic(Use Issue Template)

## Development

All tasks are tracked in their own Issues. Following checks need to be done:
1. Implement changes
2. Write automatic tests for the changes
3. Add all required log messages

## Documentation

After this Epic is completed:
- [ ] Combine all comments(Feature Mapping, Wireframing, Prototyping, Dev Tasks) into a markdown file
- [ ] Save it in this repo
